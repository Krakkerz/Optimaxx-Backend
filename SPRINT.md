# Sprint Plan

## Sprint #1 (W18 2022)
We want to get the following done in this sprint:
- Project-related
  - [x] An initial ER diagram
  - [x] Describe a few use cases/user stories
  - [x] Decide on tech stack (java version, docker, spring-security, front-end router)
- Deploy the project 
  - [x] CI/CD for both frontend and backend, azure mysql database
  - [x] Install Springdoc
- Develop the backend
  - [x] Implement the ER diagram in code
  - [x] Begin work on Paginated Rest API (GET operations > POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
  - [x] Create dummy data with configuration
- Develop the frontend
  - [x] View static data on frontend

We have completed the following so far in this sprint:
- Developed an initial ER diagram
- Described a few user stories
- Decided on a tech stack
  - Java 17 without Docker, sinze Azure supports it natively now
  - Spring Security since we want to have a user make a reservation and this seems the most feasible
  - We will use Navigo as a frontend router
  - MySQL 8
- CI/CD has been set up for both frontend and backend
- Springdoc has been installed for API documentation
- GET endpoints for movies have been created
- Manually entered a few movies as dummy data
- Frontend is able to render som static data, but it's still very early in the process

Who did what:
- Mark
 - initial ER diagram
 - entities and relational mapping
